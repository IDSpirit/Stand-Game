# Stand-Game
This program will create a personal spirit called a stand with randomised stats that can fight in turn-based combat against a CPU. The user's stand will also have one of several unique powers ranging from hair extension to seeing into the future, all of which can be used in battle. There is also the option to save all the information on a particular stand into a separate text file and then load the stand up for use in another battle. Beware though, for if you lose in your battle, there will be a hefty punishment...
